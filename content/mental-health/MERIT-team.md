### New Information
**Rochdale, Heywood and Middleton MERIT Team**

We are the MERIT team, the community mental health 
team for older people in Rochdale, Heywood and 
Middleton.  
We provide you with mental health assessment and 
monitoring if you're aged 65 and over. We may also be 
able to offer some support if you're younger but have 
dementia.

Our team is made up of eight mental health nurses, a 
mental health occupational therapist, administrator 
and team manager.

We work closely with the older age consultants based 
at Birch Hill and Royal Oldham hospitals.

We don't commission services or packages of care for 
you or your carers who support you.

Referrals to us are made via the older people's single 
point of entry service. They will screen and direct 
referrals to the most appropriate service to support 
you.

We're based on the Birch Hill Hospital site.
