### Information   
Open 8.30am to 4.45pm Mon to Fri   

### We provide multi-disciplinary assessment, treatment and care to individuals with severe and enduring mental health problems.  

We can support you if you are between 18 to 65 years of age and have a diagnosed functional mental health problem, unless your needs would be best met by the older adults community mental health team, or vice versa.   

We can support anyone who is living in Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale who suffers from a severe and enduring mental illness, such as schizophrenia, severe affective disorder or a complex personality disorder, but not autism and Aspergerâ€™s.   

We offer individual assessment of needs for up to 16 weeks, to longer term support where you will be allocated a care coordinator.   

We aim to provide the highest quality and comprehensive care to support the recovery of our service users in the community, enabling our service users to live independent, fulfilling lives and supporting significant others.   

Our community mental health teams are an integrated service, therefore we can provide support for both your health and social care needs under The Care Act 2014.   

You can self help by using the Single Point of Access. Get a form from your GP.  Fill it in. Send it off.  Wait 5 days and then phone them for an appointment.
