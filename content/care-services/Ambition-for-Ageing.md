### Information
 
Ambition for Ageing Rochdale support older people and their communities to design and develop better facilities, activities and projects to reduce isolation and help those 50 and above to keep active. We work with members of the community, businesses, health providers and any other groups and organisations that can help create Age Friendly Communities.
 
Ambition for Ageing areas:
 
The programme for Rochdale works in three communities. We have helped develop new projects to create Age Friendly activities in the following areas.
 
West Middleton : Smallbridge / Firgrove and 
Central Rochdale
 
Ambition for Ageing Investments:
 
We work closely with members of the community as well as groups and organisations to create active communities. We offer investment opportunities up to £2000 to support the community to create their own ‘Age Friendly’ projects. Groups and organisations can apply for investments which must engage and involve participants in one of our three areas. If you have an idea that you would like to discuss then please get in touch.
 
Volunteer with Us:
 
Ambition for Ageing volunteers are at the heart of our communities. Volunteers aged 50 and over are essential to developing ideas and projects, especially their understanding of the issues and needs of their community.
 
Volunteer Ambassadors
 
We are looking for volunteers aged 50 and over to get out into the community to build connections with older people, identify local assets and gather research and information to help create Age Friendly activities and services.
 
Volunteer Decision Makers
 
We are looking for volunteers to help on our decision-making panels and help decide which ideas and investments will benefit the community the most. All Ambition for Ageing volunteers receive a full induction and training.
