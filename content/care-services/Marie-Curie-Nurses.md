### Information
**What our nurses do in a nutshell**
We offer free nursing care to people with all terminal
 illnesses across the UK, as well as support for 
 family and friends. 

Our nurses generally provide one-to-one nursing care
and support overnight in your home, usually for eight
 or nine hours. 

In some areas, we also offer care for a shorter period
of time, or during the evening or daytime, as well as
care at very short notice in a crisis.

**What do Marie Curie Nurses do in your area?**
We provide nursing care in partnership with the NHS. 
We work in most parts of the UK, but the exact service 
we provide in each area varies according to what 
support the local NHS trust has decided it needs from 
us.

You can find out more about the care and support we
offer in your area, and how to get a Marie Curie 
Nurse, by talking to your district nurse or GP.

**What does a Macmillan nurse do?**
Macmillan nurses care for people with cancer, from 
when they’re first diagnosed. They generally spend up 
to an hour in someone’s home, providing advice on 
managing pain and controlling symptoms, as well as 
emotional support.

**Marie Curie Nurses care for people with all terminal
