### Information
* Last updated: Friday, 31 January 2020.  
* Please note: the following notice provides additional privacy information to the Rochdale Borough Council privacy notice.

The Place Team is a group of workers from different public services and third sector organisations, led by Rochdale Borough Council, who work together in a particular area for a period of time to support people who may need lots of different services at the same time. The idea is that, instead of having to access these services separately, it makes more sense for all organisations to work together to help the person move on. For example, a person might need help with housing, health and relationships all at the same time. That can be quite confusing so the team would help to put those services in an order that makes sense. They would also help the person to be more confident in asking for help or in learning to do something for themselves.

Information is shared between the council and its partners relating to people who need lots of support and challenge at the same time. The information is communicated by email, in person (in meetings) and over the telephone. The aim is to enable members of the Place Team to engage with individuals in order to offer help to improve their lives and ultimately to reduce high cost crisis demand on services.
