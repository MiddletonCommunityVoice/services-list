### Information   
Since the NHS was formed, Royal Voluntary Service has been a key part of the care it provides.

Through support services like hospital shops, trolley services, on ward visits and help in getting home, our volunteers help hardworking NHS staff focus on giving each patient the care they deserve. Their care also supports patients and hospital visitors through a difficult time. 

By offering a helping hand when patients return home from hospital, our volunteers improve the likelihood that they’ll have a faster and longer-lasting recovery.   

### Home from Hospital   

Most people are glad when their hospital stay is over, but it can still be difficult to readjust to life back home. There might be new medications to take, or physical therapy to do. And if friends or family can’t be there to help, it can be all too easy for a patient to end up being readmitted.

Working with NHS partners, our volunteers offer a Home from Hospital service for those with health issues coming back home after an illness, accident or surgery. They’ll provide the practical and emotional support patients need to get back on their feet.

Support begins while the patient is still in hospital, and continues with regular contacts for up to six weeks, making sure the client has everything they need to get back to a healthy, independent life as soon as they can.   

### Patient Transport
Our volunteers provide friendly Patient Transport to and from essential appointments and hospital visits for people who might not be able to drive or access public transport, due to confidence or mobility issues.

They offer more than just a lift they provide company and support along the way and can also be on hand to help patients check in for appointments.
