Sarah Bevan, Chair
I joined the Board of Independent Choices in 2014 and have been the Treasurer for 2 years. I have over 30 years work experience in the field of housing, working in both the public and voluntary sectors. In addition I have been involved with/supported various community organisations and activities over the years and also been a Board member of Knowsley Chamber of Commerce between 2013-15. My hobbies include swimming, photography, gardening and travel. Domestic violence affects all communities and I believe that Independent Choices provides an invaluable, confidential service to help women regain control over their lives.

Daisy Smith, Secretary
I’ve been a member of the Board of Trustees for Independent Choices for a number of years. I first became involved with the charity when I worked as a police analyst researching domestic abuse patterns and trends across the region. I saw what a valuable and unique role Independent Choices play in supporting those affected by domestic abuse across Greater Manchester. I find volunteering for Independent Choices rewarding both on a personal and professional level. The number of people who tell me about their own experiences of domestic abuse when I talk about Independent Choices shows how this is something which can affect anyone at any time.

Lynda Shentall, Trustee
I am a social worker and my background is in working with people who are homeless, have substance misuse issues, people living with HIV and people subject to immigration control. I have worked and volunteered in social care in and around Manchester for the last 25 years and over the past two decades and have been involved in many campaigns for the rights of people living with HIV. I have worked with women who have experienced domestic abuse throughout her career in social care. I am a feminist who passionately believes in access to support services for women who have or are experiencing domestic abuse. This has motivated me to become involved with Independent Choices.  In 2014 I started a PhD study looking at the intersection of domestic abuse among women living with HIV at the School of Social Work at UCLAN: the University of Central Lancashire.

Lynn Richards, Trustee
I left my partner in 1984 after experiencing domestic abuse. I lived in two refuges and from 1985 I joined the helpline as a volunteer. In those days the volunteers were all women who had been in refuges. Initially, I helped around the office making tea and tidying u[. After a while I started taking calls from women and helping them to access refuge. From 1995 I became a member of the management committee. I have now been involved with Independent Choices for so long that I wouldn’t know how to leave … The work that we do is so vital. I had personally kept the helpline number in my purse for years before eventually making the call and leaving.

Over the years I have seen many changes and the gradual increase in the complexity of the cases that we deal with. This has required a high level of training and expertise for the helpline staff. The work that the helpline does is invaluable. There are many women who would have been in a much worse position if it wasn’t for this service and I am grateful that we have been able to help the many thousands of women over the years.
