The University Dental Hospital of Manchester (UDHM) is 
one of the key specialist dental hospitals in the UK.  
Around 90,000 patients come to us for treatment every 
year, and we look after both adults and children.

### Outpatient Appointments  
Opening hours for patients with appointments are 
Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm.

### Emergency Dental Clinic  
Monday - Friday:  7:45am

Registration for this service is between 8:30 - 9:00am (Monday - Friday).

You can access the hospital for triage begins at 
9:00am. 
Triage is the process for determining the seriousness 
of a patient's condition and thereby how quickly they 
need to be seen.

Every patient is assessed by a Dental Nurse to 
determine if they require emergency care.

Please note that this service is limited and patients 
are treated on a first come, first served basis, other 
than those presenting as a clinical priority.
