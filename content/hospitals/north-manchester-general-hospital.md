### Information

North Manchester General Hospital is a large NHS hospital located in Crumpsall
in the north of the English city of Manchester. It is operated as part of the
Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. There is an accident and emergency unit,
together with a maternity unit, high dependency unit and a mental health wing.

The hospital has undergone extensive work regarding its size and layout. The
main entrance is in the newly built "Phase 1" part of the building, whereas
most of the wards are in the old part of the building. A&E is in the new
building, along with infectious diseases and tropical medicine.

## Visiting times

North Manchester General Hospital's visiting policy is now *open*. Visitors
are allowed access throughout the day providing their visit adheres to the
[visitor's code](http://www.pat.nhs.uk/patients-and-visitors/Bedside%20booklet.PDF),
which places limits on the number of visitors per patient in order to
combat infection or obstruct meal times.
