 Trust serves a community of 250,000 people across
  Tameside and Glossop.

We provide a range of high quality services both

  for both adults and children. 

Our vision is to improve health outcomes for our 
population and influence wider determinants of health
 through collaboration with our health and care 
 partners. 

We have a clear set of values and behaviours which we
expect all of our staff to demonstrate and these are:

* Safety
* Care
* Respect
* Communication
* Learning

## Visiting Times
*Visiting times for our medical wards are 11am until
 8pm everyday.*

Our surgical wards have a rest period during the day
 between 1pm and 3pm. This allows our patients to get
  extra rest and help with recovery. 

**What is a surgical ward?**  
If somebody has had or is waiting for surgery 
(operation), the are likely to be on a surgical ward. 

**What's a medical ward?**  
A medical ward is where the patient has not had or is
 unlikely to have surgery. 

Visiting times are displayed on the ‘safe, clean and
personal’ notice board at the entrance to each ward.
