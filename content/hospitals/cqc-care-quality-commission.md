# About the Care Quality Commission

The Care Quality Commission (CQC) is an executive non-departmental public body
of the Department of Health and Social Care of the United Kingdom. It was
established in 2009 to regulate and inspect health and social care services in
England.

It was formed from three predecessor organisations:

* the Healthcare Commission
* the Commission for Social Care Inspection
* the Mental Health Act Commission

The CQC's stated role is to make sure that hospitals, care homes, dental and
general practices and other care services in England provide people with safe,
effective and high-quality care, and to encourage them to improve. It carries
out this role through checks it carries out during the registration process all
new care services must complete, inspections and monitoring of a range of data
sources that can indicate problems with services.
