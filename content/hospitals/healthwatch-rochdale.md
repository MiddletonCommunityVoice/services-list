The Enter and View programme was implemented following a public consultation in 2018 and was based on the following care quality indicators developed by Independent Age. According to the indicators a good care home should have:

Have strong and visible management
Have staff with the time and skills to do their job
Have good knowledge of each resident and how their needs may be changing
Offer a varied programme of activities
Offer quality, choice and fexibility around food and mealtimes
Ensure residents can regularly see health professionals such as GPs, dentists, opticians and chiropodists
Accomodate residents, personal, cultural and lifestyle needs
Be an open environment where feedback is actively sought and used
