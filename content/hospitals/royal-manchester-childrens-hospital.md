### Information
Children Hospital

## Visiting Times

The wards now have set visiting times.

These times being from 1.00 pm to 5.00 pm, and then from 6.00 pm to 8.00 pm.

Parents/carers have opening visiting hours and access to the ward but should
your child have visitors please keep the number of people round a bed space to
a maximum of two parents plus an additional two people, (adults or children),
therefore there is never more than four people around your child's bed at any
one time.

During the hours of 12.00 pm and 1.00 pm, and 5.00 pm and 6.00 pm, the ward has
'protected meal times.' Any visitors arriving during this time will be asked to
return once this period is over.

There are different visiting arrangments in Critical Care which covers the
Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Paediatric High Dependency Unit and Burns
Service. Please ask your child's nurse for more information.
