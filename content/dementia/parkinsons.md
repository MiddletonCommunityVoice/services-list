### Motor Symptons of Parkingson's
  The APDA shares that it is the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s that typically make these typical daily movements more difficult, some of which include experiencing tremors, having stiff or rigid muscles, walking difficulties, slowness of movement (also known as bradykinesia), and postural instability.

Another motor symptom Parkinson’s disease patients tend to notice is a change in their voice. Changes in volume are common in the early stages, whereas speaking fast, crowding words, and stuttering are more prevalent in advanced stages of this disease.

### Non - Motor Symptoms of Parkinson's

Parkinson’s symptoms that don’t involve movement and are therefore sometimes missed, include:

- Reduced sensitivity to smells
- Trouble staying asleep
- Increased depression and anxiety
- Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions
- Fatigue
- Weight loss
- Excessive sweating
- Difficulty multi-tasking
- Harder time with organization
- Constipation
- Increase in urinary frequency and urgency
- Lightheadedness
- Reduced libido
- Slower blinking and dry eyes
