### Information
**ABOUT THE CHRISTIE**

The Christie is the largest single site cancer centre in Europe and the first UK centre to be accredited as a comprehensive cancer centre. We treat more than 60,000 patients a year.

### The Foundation Trust
As a Foundation Trust we have more freedom to develop our services for the benefit of patients - and give people a much greater say in how we do this.
