## About Osteopathy
Osteopathy is an established and respected treatment method, recognised by the British Medical Association.

It works on the idea that the way the body works mechanically, has an effect on its function and whether or not there is pain.

What an Osteopath will do is try to find any problems with the skeleton, muscles, ligaments and connective tissues and treat them using a combination of soft tissue massage, gentle stretching techniques and manipulation.

Darren Hayward has been a qualified Osteopath for over twenty years, attaining a degree from the British School of Osteopathy in 1994.

He has worked within several practices in the Manchester and Cheshire regions, helping patients of all ages, with a wide variety of acute and chronic conditions.

He also has a special interest in sports injuries and the condition M.E. or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.

As Osteopathy is a discipline that treats the whole person, rather than a set of symptoms, your first visit will take around 45 minutes. This enables a detailed history to be taken, which will include information such as medical details, nutrition and current stresses.

You may also be observed sitting, standing and walking. The quality of movement in your joints will be assessed and ligaments, tissues and muscles examined. This is where any abnormalities can be diagnosed and if this examination shows that your condition is suitable, you will be treated, either on a one off basis or over the course of a few weeks.

Most people find their treatment relaxing and enjoyable. Several techniques may be used including massage, manipulation and articulation of joints. You will also be advised on exercise, posture and relaxation methods to help you self-treat your particular condition and prevent a reoccurrence.

Some people are concerned about what to wear for an assessment and treatment - the answer to this is that Darren is always guided by what his patients find most comfortable. It is usual for an Osteopath to deal with the areas of the body that are experiencing pain, so a patient will often undress to their underwear. However, as patients sometimes prefer to be clothed, simply wearing loose light items will still enable him to carry out treatment. You can also have a friend or relative present if you would prefer to. Please feel free to call and discuss any concerns you have before your appointment.

Subsequent appointments

Because your history has already been taken, subsequent appointments will usually last around 30 minutes. Normally, anything between two and six treatments are required. This will be discussed during your initial consultation. Often patients choose a periodic preventative treatment to avoid recurring problems.

In safe hands

Osteopaths train for 4 years to complete their degree. All Osteopaths have well established training programmes adhering to strict ethical guidelines that operate in much the same way that the GMC regulates doctors.

Their training and experience enables them to recognise clinical problems and refer patients on for investigation or treatment when necessary.

For any further information you can look at the websites of the General Osteopathic Council and the Institute of Osteopathy.
