About us

People have the power to change the places they live and the things they care about. 

At Action Together we know that people can make things
 happen because we see it everyday. Across Oldham,
  Rochdale and Tameside, there are thousands of people changing lives, improving neighbourhoods and 
  contributing positively to our local area. Action

Together offers a range of support to strengthen
 communities. We believe that by learning together, 
 sharing skills and pooling resources we can get more 
 done. 

â€‹We support people to get help, providing 
opportunities to get better connected to what is going
 on in their local community and find the support they
  need.

We strengthen community and voluntary groups by 
providing support to run their group, find and secure
 resources and work together to do more.

We encourage local people, businesses and the public
 sector to give their time, skills and resources to
  support local good causes.

To find out how you can give help, or get help accross
