Psychological Support
BASIC provides Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing (EMDR).

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy. It can help people who are experiencing a wide range of mental health difficulties. What people think can affect how they feel and how they behave. CBT offers a range of therapies based on concepts and principles derived from psychological models of human emotion and behaviour. They include a wide range of treatment approaches for emotional disorders, from structured individual psychotherapy to self-help material.

Eye Movement Desensitation and Reprocessing (EMDR) is a powerful psychological treatment. A wealth of research has demonstrated its benefits in treating psychological trauma arising from experiences as diverse as war related experiences, assault, surgical trauma, road traffic accidents and workplace accidents, childhood sexual abuse/physical abuse or neglect, or natural disaster.

Our psychological services are provided by:

Wendy Edge MSc in Cognitive and Behavioural Psychotherapies, Accredited CBT Therapist and Accredited EMDR therapist. Member of BABCP, EMDR UK & Ireland.

Nicola Kitching, Chartered Clinical Psychologist, C.Psychol and Accredited EMDR therapist. Member of the British Psychological Society and EMDR UK and Ireland.
