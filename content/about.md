# Dislaimer

** Before using our directory, please note our next
monthly meeting is Wednesday. Dec. 11th. 2019 at the
Lighthouse Project from 10am til 12 midday and features
The Northern Care Alliance on local hospitals and a
local working GP about their services.


Welcome to this directory of services which is aimed
at all residents of Middleton, young or old.

This directory has been compiled from many 
public sources available online & from printed materials.

Because lots of services come and go, and some just change
their names, other services vary without any notice,
it is impossible to maintain 100% correct information.
For this reason we cannot accept any responsibility or 
liabiltity for any errors or ommissions. Nor do we endorse
any of the services on this website.

If you find any errors or missing services we would be pleased
to hear from you. You can contact us via email to
[betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com), or send a
text message only to 0797 070 8448.

**Calls to this number will not be answered and voicemails will
not be acted upon**
