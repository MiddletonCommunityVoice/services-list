## Disclaimer

This directory has been compiled to help local people find services that can benefit their lives or situation. The information has been collected from many public sources, including online and printed materials. 

Some services come and go, and some change their details without notice. It's therefore impossible to maintain 100% accuracy.  For this reason we cannot accept any responsibility or liabiltity for any errors or ommissions.  Nor do we endorse any of the services listed.

If you find any errors, or require an update please send an email to [betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com).

The directory can be searched using the main category links below. For a more detailed topical search click on the **A-Z tags button** which will take you to a list of all the service tags used in the directory.
