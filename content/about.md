# Better Health 4 Middleton Services Directory Dislaimer

Welcome to this directory of services which is aimed at all residents of
Middleton, but especially people who are:

  * **50+**, or
  * **children and teenagers**

However the directory does cover everyone. This directory has been compiled from many 
public sources available online and printed materials.

Because lots of services come and go, and some just change their names, other
services vary without any notification it is impossible to maintain 100%
correct information. For this reason we cannot accept any responsibility or liabiltity for
any errors or ommissions.  Nor do we endorse any of the services.

If you find any errors or missing services we would be pleased to hear
from you. You can contact us via [email](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com), or send a
text message on;y to 079 7070 8448.

**Calls to this number will not be answered and voicemails will not be acted upon**
