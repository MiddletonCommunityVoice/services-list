# Middleton Services Directory

Welcome to this directory of services which is aimed at the people of
Middleton, especially people who are:

  * **50+**, or
  * **children and teenagers**

The directory does cover everyone. This directory has been compiled from many public
sources available online and printed materials.

Because lots of services come and go, some just change their names, and
services vary without any notification it is impossible to maintain 100%
correct information. For this reason we cannot accept any responsibility for
any errors or ommissions.

However, if you find any errors or missing services we would be pleased to hear
from you. You can contact us via [email](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com), [raise
a issue](https://github.com/MiddletonCommunityVoice/services-list/issues) or send a
text message to 07970 708 448.

**Calls to this number will not be answered and voicemails will not be acted upon**
