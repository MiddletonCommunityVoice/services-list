WELCOME to this directory of services which is aimed
at all residents of Middleton, young or old. Can be
used by people outside Middleton as many services
are provided by organisations beyond Middleton.

This directory has been compiled from many 
public sources available online & from printed materials.

Because services come and go, some just change
their names, other services vary without any notice,
it is impossible to maintain 100% correct information.
For this reason we cannot accept any responsibility or 
liabiltity for any errors or ommissions. Nor do we
endorse any of the services on this website.

If you find any errors or missing services we would be pleased
to hear from you. You can contact us via email to
[betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com), or send a
TEXT message only to 0797 070 8448.

**TEXT MESSAGES ONLY. Calls to this number will not be
answered and voicemails will not be acted upon**
