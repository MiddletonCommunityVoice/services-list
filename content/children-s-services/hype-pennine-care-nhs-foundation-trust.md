## Information

14 -16 with emotional problems, Advice tor their parents / Carers

### What can we offer?

HYPe offers a free and confidential counselling service.  Our counsellors are
fully trained and are experienced in working with young people and the kinds of
emotional problems you face.

#### You will be accepted as an individual, be listened to and not be judged

We always respect your opinions and ask for your feedback on our service so we
can make sure it’s the sort of service young people want. HYPe welcomes
suggestions on how to improve its services, so please contact us.  We also
offer one-to-one counselling sessions in different locations in Heywood,
Middleton and Rochdale.

At your first introductory appointment you will be given information and our
confi dentiality policy. This will be fully explained to you. You can attend
this introduction on your own or have a relative, carer or care worker with
you. All other appointments will be just for you and your regular counsellor.

We are a short term service usually offering up to six sessions. This can be
extended, after consultation, to a maximum of 10 sessions. Sessions last up to
50 minutes.

If English isn’t your first language, we can provide an interpreter.


#### Patient Advice and Liaison Service

The Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) acts on behalf of service users,
families and carers to negotiate prompt solutions and help bring about changes
in the way that services are developed. As well as providing a confi dential
advice and support service, PALS will help guide you through the different
services available from the NHS.
