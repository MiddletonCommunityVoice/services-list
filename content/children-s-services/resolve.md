### Information
Counselling: Emotional health / wellbeing for children affected by domestic or sexual abuse

### Information
We recognise that growing up can be stressful and worrisome at times. Feeling sad, lonely, worried, angry, confused, frightened and mis-understood, are common feelings. We also know children, young people and families can become ‘unwell’ at times.

We complement existing providers such as Health, Education and Children’s Services, by intervening early with children or young people experiencing mental and emotional wellbeing issues and treating the whole family system, not just the identified service user, that fall below the level of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).
