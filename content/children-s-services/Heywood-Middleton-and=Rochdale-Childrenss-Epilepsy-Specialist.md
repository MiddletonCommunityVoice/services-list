## Information   
Open 8am to 8pm everyday, including Sunday's   

We work with children and young people, aged from birth to 19 years, who have epilepsy. We also support families and carers.   

We are part of the children's acute and ongoing needs service.   

We want to make sure that children and young people receive all the support and information they need to stay healthy, live a full life, and stay out of hospital.   

We provide care in the community, such as in a health centre or clinic, or in the home. We work from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.   

We work closely with other professionals who help to support the child, for example paediatricians (children's doctors) or neurologists (a doctor who is an expert in conditions that affect the brain, spinal cord or nerves).   

We accept referrals  from educational, health, social care professionals for any child who has an epilepsy diagnosis.   

You can stay up to date with lots of advice and information by following our dedicated Facebook page.   

Referals via your GP or a health professional
