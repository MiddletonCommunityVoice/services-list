# Vision, mission and values

## Our vision

A world without dementia.

## Our mission

Our mission is to transform the landscape of dementia forever. Until the day we find a cure, we will strive to create a society where those affected by dementia are supported and accepted, able to live in their community without fear or prejudice.

## Our new values

Our People feel a strong connection to what we stand for and how we deliver
for people affected by dementia.  It's the glue that binds us together.
However, that doesn't mean that they can never change.  

As we evolve and raise our ambitions, our values need to evolve too.  New
challenges require new ways of working, thinking and problem solving – while
retaining what makes us a special place to work.​​

230 people have been involved in shaping these values. This includes all
levels of employees and volunteers across Society – and people affected by
dementia. Overwhelming feedback was to make them short, punchy, active and
something that captures the essence of who we are. They support our new bolder
brand too – fitting in to how we want to be known.

## Our new values

Committed to creating a world without dementia,

* **We get it:** we are trusted experts, informed and inspired by people
affected by dementia

* **We are united:** together we achieve more

* **We will do it:** we demand and deliver lasting change.
