The Royal Oldham Hospital is a NHS hospital in Oldham, Greater Manchester,
England. It forms part of Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust and was opened with
its present name on 1 December 1989. Its services are commissioned by NHS

Formerly known as Oldham and District General Hospital, the hospital lies
within the Coldhurst area of Oldham on the boundary with Royton.[1] It was the
birthplace of Louise Brown, the world's first successful in vitro fertilised
"test tube baby", on 25 July 1978.

The hospital also has its own radio station, known as Radio Cavell.
