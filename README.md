# Middleton Services Directory

Welcome to this directory of services which is aimed at the people of Middleton, especially
  * 50+
  * children and teenagers

The directory covers everyone. This directory has been compiled from many public
sources available online and printed materials.

Because lots of services come and go, some just change their names, and
services vary without any notification it is impossible to have all the
information 100% correct and upto date. For this reason we cannot accept any
responsibility for any errors or ommissions.  However, if you find any errors
or missing services we would be pleased to hear from you.

You can contact us via [email](mailto:betterhealth4middleton@gmail.com) or raise an issue on this repository.
